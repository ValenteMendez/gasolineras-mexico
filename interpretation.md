## Executive Summary

Mexico's gasoline market has experienced significant price volatility and shifting consumption patterns in recent years, driven by global oil price fluctuations, currency dynamics, tax policy adjustments, and structural challenges in domestic refining. As of mid-2024, retail gasoline prices reached record highs (Ps23.73/l for regular, Ps25.38/l for diesel)[^1]. By end of 2024, retail gasoline prices had continued growing to (Ps24.26/l for regular, Ps25.71/l for premium, Ps26.11/l for diesel) - prices shown in this analysis. Interestingly enough, volumes demonstrated resilience despite economic pressures. This report analyzes the interplay of factors shaping prices and volumes, explores regional disparities, and evaluates the outlook for Mexico's gasoline market.

## Section 1: Price Dynamics and Contributing Factors

### 1.1 International Oil Prices and Exchange Rate Pressures

Mexico’s gasoline prices are closely tied to global crude oil benchmarks, with 60% of refined products imported from the U.S.[^13]. In 2024, delivered U.S. Gulf Coast gasoline prices to Mexico’s east coast rose 5% year-over-year to \$2.34/USG, while diesel prices increased 10% to \$2.50/USG[^1]. The Mexican peso’s depreciation exacerbated these costs, weakening to Ps18.13/\$1 in June 2024 (a 5% decline from 2023)[^1], directly inflating import expenses.

### 1.2 Fiscal Policy and Subsidy Reductions

Government tax policies significantly influenced retail prices:

- **Excise Tax (IEPS) Deductions:** Reduced from Ps1.2845/l to Ps0.3621/l for regular gasoline between 2023 and 2024, effectively raising net prices by 8%[^1].
- **Subsidy Cuts:** Diesel subsidies fell 15% YoY in June 2024, aligning with fiscal consolidation efforts[^1].
- **Price Stabilization Mechanism:** The government’s commitment to cap prices at November 2018 levels (in real terms) expired in 2023, leading to market-driven adjustments[^8].


### 1.3 Refining Inefficiencies and Import Dependency

Despite investments in refinery upgrades (e.g., the Olmeca refinery), Pemex’s six domestic refineries operated at 51.3% capacity in May 2024[^13]. Low utilization rates forced continued reliance on imports, which accounted for 65% of gasoline and diesel demand[^13]. Operational bottlenecks and frequent outages at facilities like Minatitlán (32% utilization) and Cadereyta (32%)[^13] limited domestic supply, exposing markets to import parity pricing.

---

## Section 2: Consumption Volumes and Demand Drivers

### 2.1 Sales Trends and Economic Activity

- **Pemex Sales:** Gasoline sales reached 688,000 bpd in August 2024 (+22% YoY), driven by post-pandemic mobility recovery and economic growth[^3][^12]. Diesel demand grew to 314,000 bpd, supported by industrial and freight transport activity[^3].
- **Regional Variations:** Northern states (e.g., Baja California) saw higher per-capita consumption due to cross-border trade and tourism, while central regions faced stagnation amid urbanization and public transit adoption[^23].


### 2.2 Vehicle Fleet and Efficiency

Mexico’s vehicle fleet surpassed 40 million in 2024, with gasoline-powered vehicles representing 85% of the total[^16]. However, fuel efficiency gains (3% annual improvement since 2020) offset mileage growth, stabilizing national consumption at ~1.1 million bpd[^30].

### 2.3 Premium Gasoline Surge Myth

Diverse sources [^27] register a Premium gasoline (92-octane) surge in volumes, however, the analysis of official numbers show that it still represents ˜16% of volumen (similar to 2023). 

---

## Section 3: Regional Price Disparities and Market Structure

### 3.1 Geographic Pricing Mechanisms

- **Northern Border Subsidy:** Stations within 45 km of the U.S. border receive subsidies up to Ps4.55/l to deter cross-border purchases, creating a Ps3–5/l price gap versus central states[^22].
- **Transportation Costs:** Interior states (e.g., Oaxaca, Chiapas) face premiums of Ps2–3/l due to pipeline constraints and reliance on trucked fuel[^6].


### 3.2 Competition and Station Density

- **Urban Markets:** High station density in Mexico City and Monterrey correlated with 10–12% lower markups versus rural areas[^6]. Banxico research found a 1% increase in station density reduced prices by 0.3%[^21].
- **Rocket-and-Feathers Effect:** Price adjustments lagged wholesale declines by 5–7 days in low-competition regions, widening margins during market downturns[^6].


### 3.3 Regulatory and Anti-Competitive Practices

CRE identified tacit collusion in 15% of municipalities, where dominant clusters (e.g., Grupo Orsan in Yucatán) maintained supracompetitive pricing through price signaling[^23]. Anti-trust investigations in 2024 targeted zones with abnormally high margins (>20%) despite low import costs[^23].

---

## Section 4: Future Outlook and Risks

### 4.1 Policy and Investment Scenarios

- **Refining Expansion:** The Olmeca refinery (340,000 bpd capacity) is projected to reach 50% utilization by 2026, reducing imports by 150,000 bpd[^38].
- **Tax Reforms:** Proposed carbon taxes (Ps500/tCO2) could add Ps1.2–1.8/l to prices by 2026[^37].
- **Electric Vehicle (EV) Adoption:** EVs are forecast to capture 5% of new sales by 2027, trimming gasoline demand growth by 0.5% annually[^29].


### 4.2 Global Market Risks

- **OPEC+ Production Cuts:** Extended quotas through 2025 may sustain Brent at \$74–80/bbl, pressuring Mexico’s import costs[^32].
- **U.S. Refinery Closures:** Shutdowns of LyondellBasell’s Houston plant (263,776 bpd) and Phillips 66’s Los Angeles facility (138,700 bpd) could tighten regional supply, raising Gulf Coast benchmarks[^34].


### 4.3 Economic and Currency Pressures

Banxico forecasts 2025 GDP growth at 1.4%, with inflation stabilizing at 3.9%[^18]. A peso depreciation to Ps19.5/\$1 (8% decline) could add Ps1.5–2/l to gasoline costs, assuming flat international prices[^18].

---

## Conclusion

Mexico’s gasoline market remains vulnerable to external shocks, with prices driven by imported product parity and fiscal policies. To mitigate volatility and disparities, policymakers should:

1. **Accelerate Refining Modernization:** Prioritize Pemex’s operational efficiency to achieve 75%+ utilization, reducing import reliance.
2. **Enhance Competition:** Expand CRE’s mandate to penalize regional collusion and streamline station permitting.
3. **Targeted Subsidies:** Replace broad tax cuts with means-tested transportation vouchers in high-poverty states.
4. **Price Transparency:** Mandate real-time price reporting via platforms like GasoApp to empower consumer choice.

As Mexico navigates energy transition pressures, balancing affordability, fiscal sustainability, and decarbonization will define the market’s trajectory through 2030.
